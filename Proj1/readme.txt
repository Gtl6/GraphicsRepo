Reason for resubmission: Whilst demonstrating my rotating string to my buddy Michael, I realized I couldn't rotate things along the x-axis, which for some reason was almost non-noticeable. This had to do with the divide by 0 issue, so I fixed it by tweaking my matrix library. It works now.

Includes all files for project 1
	- proj1.c (the source code)
	- matrixlib (the matrix lib, slightly updated from lab3)
	- all other files necessary for compiling and running the project
	- also a makefile, for your making convenience

To run, just go ahead and give it a 'make', and then a ./proj1

The only item of note is that I did not do the "just for fun" portion of this project. Although I normally would, next week is completely swamped so I'm afraid I couldn't burn the extra time it would have taken. However, the rest of the project does work.
