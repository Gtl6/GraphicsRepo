To build, just type make.

Controls: rotate the viewport with wasd. move the light with ijkl. Zoom in and out with q and e, move the light up and down with u and o. Press space to begin the animation, and you can stop and start at will. Also, for posterity's sake - based on a tip from a friend in class, updated the surface of the lightbub to reflect diffuse light strongly (giving its brightness).
